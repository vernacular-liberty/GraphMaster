# GraphMaster
Application to teach graph theory to students.

## Instructions
Build a vertices by clicking the place on the panel where you want your vertex to go.

Build an edge by clicking a vertex and dragging your mouse to the next vertex.

To Analyze the total degree of vertices in the graph click "Find Degree of Vertices" in the toolbar.
    *You can continue building the graph, but you must re select "Find Degree of Vertices" to update the graphs vertices.

To Analyze the degrees of each vertex in the graph click  "Find Degree of Each Vertex" in the toolbar.
    *You can continue building the graph, but you must re select "Find Degree of Each Vertex" to update the analysis.

To build a new graph click "New Graph" in the tool bar.
